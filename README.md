To train a classifier to answer unseen questions from the CommonSense QA dataset, which is a dataset comprising mutliple choice questions that are common knowledge to humans. The idea is to try to capture a semantic relationship between the question and answer choices, and then treating it as a multiclass classification problem.

### Data:

### Models used: 
BERT, Best accuracy of 65% with roBERTa-base model

### Application: 
A potential area of use could be in the education sector. This can be used to auto-identify answers on exams or can be part of a larger project of completely automated multiple choice test generation.
